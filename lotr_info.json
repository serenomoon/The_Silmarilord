This allowed the Rohirrim to arrive in time to fight the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

His name is pronounced kar-ka-roth. Carcharoth was created as a defence against Huan and was reared by Morgoth's own hands on living flesh and filled with great power. So Carcharoth, who was also named Anfauglir, the 'Jaws of Thirst', grew to great size and his strength seemed beyond compare. His eyes burned like red coals and his teeth were poisoned as the spears of the Orcish legions. Carcharoth was the guardian of the gate of Angband and none could pass him by strength of body alone.",
